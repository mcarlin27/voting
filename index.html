        <h1>Voting!</h1>
        <h2>So you want to vote, huh?</h2>
        <p>Good for you! The right to vote has been exercised in this country going back to 1776, though, of course, back then such rights were restricted to white, property-owning Protestant men. Non-Protestants were granted rights to vote by 1828, when Maryland became the last state to enfranchise (white) Jews. By 1856 the property-requirement had also been dropped, removing the last barier for white men to vote. By 1870 that right was extended to non-white males, though in practice many states passed so-called "grandfather clauses," which denied the vote to any man whose grandfather had been denied the vote himself (though these laws were themselves declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1915). White women gained the vote in 1920, followed by Native Americans in 1948, and all other persons of legal voting age in 1965 with the passage of the Voting Rights Act.
